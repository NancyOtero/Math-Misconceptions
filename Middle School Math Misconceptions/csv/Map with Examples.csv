Initially, she looked at the relationship between 6 and 4 and then said in 2,
4, 6 there are three. This was an intriguing construction because ""in 2, 4, 6
there are three so I divided by 3"" seems to indicate that she constructed a
scheme in which the composite unit consisted of three ratio units. It means
that:

A sizable number of children added (5 + 3) before subtracting and multiplied (3 x 2) before dividing. One possible explanation might be that they have generalized incorrectly the rule for the order of operations and believe that addition takes precedence over subtraction and multiplication over division (e.g., in many textbooks we find that the order of operations is given as: Brackets first then 'Of', Multiplication, Division, Addition and Subtraction, often referred to as BOMDAS). Another explanation by one of the children re- flected another incorrect generalization, namely, ""Addition and subtraction are at the same level, so we choose what to do first as is more convenient"". One possible explanation might be that they have generalized incorrectly the rule for the order of operations and believe that addition takes precedence over subtraction and multiplication over division.

Question 3 was answered correctly by all students, as they knew that the
 bracketed operation had to be performed first.

the coordinate for the y-intercept (0, 3) rather than (0, –3). This led him to
make an error in calculating ∆y by subtracting 0 from 3 rather than from –3.
In so doing, he arrived at a value for the slope of the function that was
negative—an impossible solution given that the graph is of an increasing
linear function. This slip, by itself, is of less concern than the fact that the student did not recognize the inconsistency between the positive slope of

linear. He appears to have estimated and recorded coordinate points by
visually reading them off the graph without regard for whether the final
table embodied linearity. Furthermore, the student did not realize that the

Car Wash Problem (inverse variation)
Metro Car Sales hires washers to wash the cars in their lot. The manager knows that 36
washers can wash all the cars in 1 hour.
a) What if only half as many washers worked? How long would it take 18 washers to
wash all the cars? How long for 72 washers? How long for 9 washers? How long for
4 washers?
b) Describe how the manager could figure out how many hours it would take to wash
the cars for any size group of washers.
c) Write an equation for finding the number of hours it takes to wash the cars if you know

the number of washers. Let H represent the number of hours it takes, and let S repre-
sent the number of washers.

d) Can you use your equation to find how long it would take 10 washers?",Question,,,,
,,,,,,,,"In the Car Wash Problem, which is an inverse variation situation, students could
compute the time required to wash the cars given half or twice as many washers,
but they had difficulty computing the time required in other cases. Given that 36
washers take I hour, 9 of the 10 students responded that 18 washers would take
twice as long and 8 of the 10 students responded that 72 washers would take half
as long. When the 18 was halved to 9 washers, only 5 of the 10 students doubled
the time again. Four students used additive strategies such as the following:
S6: Three hours

... Well, if this takes 2 hours [for 18 to wash the cars] and there is half
as many ... , then it would take another hour. S4: Two and one half hours. (I: Okay, and how did you get that?) I knew it was 2 hours
for 18 and I just added another half hour to that.
For the question of how long it would take four washers to wash the cars, only one
student correctly answered 9 hours. Some estimated on the basis of their answers
for nine washers. For example, the following two students had correctly answered
that nine student washers would take 4 hours. They were asked how long it would
take four washers:
S1: Four students? This is just a guess, but 4 hours and 45 minutes. (I: How did you find
that? Just a guess or did you calculate it?) No, actually it is almost one person less than
half of 9, so then it is a quarter less.
S7: On the last thing we did was nine [washers] and nine had 4 hours. And what we have
been doing the whole time is just doubling it. So I'd say say 4 is about half of 9, so it would
have to equal twice the time, which is 8 [hours].",Answer,,,,

• (1, 1, 1, 0): 8 students [indicating HS structure sense developed, SSE-3 (UA) developed, SSP (UA) lacking]
• (1, 1, 1, 1): 4 students [indicating HS and UA structure sense developed] (0, 0, , ) occurred in 2 cases divided as follows:
• (0, 0, 0, 0): 1 student [indicating neither HS nor UA structure sense]
• (0, 0, 1, 0): 1 student [we explained this case in the remark in R1-1: The student remembered that a denominator cannot equal 0 and did not need to use HS structure sense—he did not simplify the expression]

Although there were other foursomes, most of them were unique cases; we mention only those that occurred more frequently:
• (1, 0, 0, 0): 3 students [no UA structure sense]
• (1, 0, 1, 0): 4 students [SSE-3 (UA) developed, SSP (UA) lacking]
All, (bar one, explained above) of these cases could be explained by our hypotheses.
SSE (Structure Sense as Applied to Elements of Sets and the Notion of Binary Operation)
SSP (Structure Sense as Applied to Properties of Binary Operations)
R1-1: A student who does not have a high level of structure sense 2 (HS) cannot display a high level of SSE-2 (UA).

Car Wash Problem (inverse variation)
Metro Car Sales hires washers to wash the cars in their lot. The manager knows that 36
washers can wash all the cars in 1 hour.
a) What if only half as many washers worked? How long would it take 18 washers to
wash all the cars? How long for 72 washers? How long for 9 washers? How long for
4 washers?
b) Describe how the manager could figure out how many hours it would take to wash
the cars for any size group of washers.
c) Write an equation for finding the number of hours it takes to wash the cars if you know
the number of washers. Let H represent the number of hours it takes, and let S represent the number of washers.
d) Can you use your equation to find how long it would take 10 washers?",,,
,,,,,Sample Question 2022,Answer ,,"Student 1:

Solving:

7 - 1/2 = 18

- 1/2 = 11

n = 22


Checking:

7 - 1/2 · 22 = 18

7 + 11 = 18

18 = 18


Student 2:

Solving:

7 - 1/2 n = 18

7 - 1/2 n + 7 = 18 + 7

- 1/2 n = 25

1 n = 50


Checking:

7 - 25 = 18

Given that 36 washers take I hour, 9 of the 10 students responded that 18 washers would take twice as long and 8 of the 10 students responded that 72 washers would take half as long.

D. The y-intercepts of the lines cannot be equal.","Sample Correct Response:

(a) Correct selection:

C. The slopes of the lines cannot be equal.

(b) Explanation:

The slopes cannot be equal because if they were equal, the lines would be parallel. Distinct parallel lines do not intersect.

NOTES:

Acceptable explanations include those that address the idea that if two lines in the xy-plane have the same slope then they would either

- not intersect, or
- be parallel, or
- be the same line, or
- intersect in infinitely many points.

Partially acceptable explanations include those that give an acceptable explanation with additional incorrect information.",,,,,,,
