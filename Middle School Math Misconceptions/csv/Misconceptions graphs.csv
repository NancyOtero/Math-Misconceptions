In September 2010","For the 50% who had the correct answer and incorrect or blank explanation there were a variety of explanations including: no explanation (5%), it (the yaxis) increases by small numbers making it looker bigger than big numbers (5%), the graph is shortened in the corner (5%), the graph starts at 8,000 (15%), disagrees that it appears that there are three times as many on day two than on day one (5%), only mentions heights of the bars (5%), only mentions the increments of 125 (5%), and does not mention the break (5%). For the 10% that also had the incorrect answer along with the incorrect explanation the responses incorrectly stated that the y-axis increases by increments of 150 (instead of 125) (5%), and day two was shaded high (5%). All of these incorrect explanations can be directed back to the fact that the student lacked some understanding or awareness of the discontinuous scale on the y-axis",three times the amount of the other bar,Difficulty interpreting graph-scale. 60% ,"Correct answer and correct explanation 40%
