,Ratios and proportional relationships,,The number system,,Expressions and equations,,Functions,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
1,"Misunderstanding the connections among proportional relationships such as part/whole, part/part, whole/part",,Incorrectly or procedurally using fraction algorithms (without understanding them conceptually),,Believing that the equal sign means “the answer is” rather than expressing a relationship,,Lacking understanding of and not seeing the connection between multiple representations of functions,,,  
,,,,,,,,,,
2,Holding a rigid understanding of proportionality – absolute vs. relative,,Ordering decimals incorrectly basing the value of a decimal on incorrect reasoning such as the number of digits,,Incorrectly viewing variables as labels or units,,Not understanding a linear function represents a rate of change,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
3,Inability to unitize,,Avoidance of negative numbers,,Believing that two variables in the same equation cannot represent the same value,,Not understanding what makes a function proportional or non-proportional ,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
4,Lack of recognition of the different ways a ratio can be written – equivalent ratios and complex ratios,,Ignoring negative signs,,Believing that that the value of a variable has something to do with its position in the alphabet,,Difficulty understanding the concept of the independent and dependent variables ,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
5,Inability to recognize ratios can represent the same units or different units,,Difficulty with a subtraction sign followed by a negative sign (e.g. 4 − (−1)),,Failing to understand that variables can represent varying quantities,,Difficulty explaining what the slope and y-intercept represents ,,Not in NAEP,
,,,,,,,,,,
6,Inability to recognize that ratios are a relationship between two quantities,,Using faulty reasoning for performing order of operations such as performing operations left to right,,Difficulty understanding the concept of like terms,,Inability to graph a function,,Mapped,
,,,,,,,,,,
7,Confusion with ratios written as quotients,,Believing that the commutative and associative properties are true for subtraction and division,,Inability to represent a situation algebraically such as the reversal order error,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,Difficulty substituting solutions back into the equation to check answers,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,Incorrect application of the distributive property when simplifying expressions or solving equations,,,,,
