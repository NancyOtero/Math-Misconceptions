analyzed for 14-year-old students (Perrenet, Mertens, Herfs, & Terwel, 1989).
The students were asked to write down the solving procedure and the checking
procedure. When analyzing the work of these students we were confronted with
examples of incorrect peculiar checking behavior.

This article reports the results of a study in which a group of eighth-grade students was presented with a set of linear equation-solving and checking tasks. A few weeks later some selected students were interviewed in detail on the checking behavior manifested in their notes on the previously presented paper-and-pencil task.

paper-and-pencil task to 83 students in the eighth grade of two high schools. (M age = 14).","The Checking-with-Help Score is a score from 0 to 2. Score 0 is given wher

work either. ",,"Protocol Sandra. The protocol gives an example of a logical error: substitution of different values
for the same variable. Sandra has substituted m = 3 on the right-hand side of the
equation m - 3 = 4m and m = 15 on the left-hand side. In this way both sides
become the same, that is equal to 12. 

","Of the total 83 students, 29 students show no checking behavior at all and 10 students
show the correct checking behavior on the paper-and-pencil task. Thirty-four
students commit the commonly observed errors noted previously. The students
we selected for the interview session are the 14 students who show the checking
errors in more than one problem. 

The Checking Score is a quartile score that varies from 0 to 3. Per student the
calculation of the score is based upon those problems where a solution (correct or
incorrect) was found or given. The reason is, that for checking, a possible
solution is required first. The percentage of correct checking procedures out of
possible checking procedures is then computed. For 0% to 25% the score 0 was
given, for 25% to 50% the score 1 was given, for 50% to 75% the score 2 was
given, and for 75% to 100% the score 3 was given. ",,

Vlassis's (2008),4 -x = 5.,"Vlassis found that students had three main difficulties with this equation. First, some students tried to find a number that could be substituted into the equation (e.g. guess and check) and could not arrive at an answer because the lowest number they would consider was zero (did not consider using negatives).  Second, several students who originally obtained the solution ofx =-1 became confused when they checked their solution by plugging x = -1 back into the original equation: 4 -(-1) = 5. These students believed that it was not possible to have two ""subtraction"" signs placed side by side. A final difficultly students had with this equation was that they simply omitted the negative sign. After subtracting four from both sides of the equation instead of simplifying to -x = 1 they simplified to x = 1, resulting in an incorrect solution",,,,,,,
