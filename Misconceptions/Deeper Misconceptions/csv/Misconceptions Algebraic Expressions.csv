,"Booth and Watson (1990), Booth (1986), Kilpatrick et al. (2001), and Stacey and MacGregor (1997b) found that students (1) struggle with algebraic expressions because they do not conceptually understand what the variables mean, especially terms such as 7ab; and (2) struggle to understand an answer to a problem that is something other than a number (e.g. 3x + 1).",,,,,,,

,p. 2,David is 10 cm taller than Con. Con is h cm tall. What can you write for David’s height?,SELF,"Response and Assumed Reason:

Dh
This abbreviation stands for the words “David’s height.”

C + 10 = D
The C means “Con’s height,” and the D means “David’s height.”

h = h + 10
The h denotes the concept of height, so that it can refer to both people’s heights in this problem.


18
Since H is the eighth letter of the alphabet, 8 + 10 

= 18.

R
The tenth letter after H in the alphabet is R.

160
Think of a reasonable height for Con (e.g., 150 cm); add 10.

11
Any letter equals 1 unless specified otherwise; therefore, 10 + h = 10 + 1 = 11.

h10 or 10h
A letter next to a numeral indicates addition.

h10
The 10 on the “positive,” or righthand, side of h means “10 more.”","150 cm is a reasonable height for Con, so David’s height would be 160 cm.","• Students’ interpretations of algebraic symbolism are based on other experiences that are not helpful.

• The use of letters in algebra is not the same as their use in other contexts.

• The grammatical rules of algebra are not the same as ordinary language rules.

• Most children in a class of eleven-year-olds who had never been taught algebra guessed that letters stood for abbreviated words—D for David and h for height—or for specific numbers

they confuse the meaning of the letters or give them some invalid value",Success rates were much lower than we had expected and ranged from 50 percent for students in their first year of algebra learning up to 75 percent for students in their third or fourth year of algebra learning.,

,"Kieran (1992) noted that, in addition to understanding what expressions mean, students struggle to accurately simplify expressions. For example, students attempt to simplify 30x – 5 to 25x or they do not correctly carry out the distributive property. Dede (2004) confirmed that finding claiming that students often incorrectly simplify an expression such as 2 + 5x to 7x. Another common misconception mentioned by Capraro and Joffrion (2006) was evident when students were asked to write a subtraction expression. Students often wrote “four less than a number” as 4 – n instead of n – 4.",,,,,,,

,"As mentioned previously, students are challenged by the difference between a variable and a label. For example, Weinberg et al. (2004) administered a written assessment of knowledge of algebraic expressions to sixth-, seventh-, and eighth- graders. They also interviewed 31 of the sixth-graders in semi-structured videotaped sessions. One question on the written assessment was the following: Cakes cost c dollars each and brownies cost b dollars each. Suppose I buy 4 cakes and 3 brownies. What does 4c + 3b stand for?

Our written assessment was administered to 373 students (123 sixth-graders, 115
seventh-graders and 135 eighth-graders) in a middle school. Thirty-one sixth-graders participated
a videotaped, semi-structured interview (all but four of the interview participants also completed
the written assessment). These written assessment and interview items will be administered to
the current sixth-graders for two more years to enable us to gather longitudinal data on their

know how to respond, or gave responses that could not be classified into statistically significant
groups.

","Since the correct answer is given by the expression 4c+3b in its entirety (that is, one must somehow “join” the 4c and 3b which represent distinct parts of the total cost), students need either to view 4c+3b as an encapsulated quantity or to have experience with similar questions.",,"Student Responses by Grade

Question 2: Cakes cost c dollars each and brownies cost b dollars each. Suppose I buy 4 cakes and 3 brownies. What does 4c + 3b stand for? (Weinberg, et aI., 2004, p. 4) The results from Question 1 showed that, fewer students answered ""yes"" for part d than for part b or c. This result was not surprising considering students often perceive a variable to represent an object or one number, which they do not view as an expression meeting this criterion. Additionally, eighth-graders had higher percentages than sixth-or seventh-graders and the seventh-graders scored better than the sixth-graders. On Question 2, several students (22%, 37%, and 27% percent in grades 6, 7, 8 respectively) incorrectly stated that 4c + 3b meant 4 cakes and 3 brownies. This suggested that the students incorrectly viewed the variables as labels -  with c meaning cakes instead of ""times the cost of a cake"" and b meaning brownies instead of ""times the cost of brownies"" (as also found in a similiar problem in Swan, 2000). The interview portion of the study revealed a wide range of responses, and no apparent patterns emerged (Weinberg et aI., 2004).",,,,,,,

Since students may view n as representing a single place value, they may not think it could

It is unlikely that students, especially in 6th and 7th grades (where they have not yet had much experience substituting expressions for variables), will

variable as the act of substituting an “object” for the variable. If 3r+2 indicates the process of
