,"Brown and Quinn found that students had a fragmented understanding of fraction concepts and fraction operations and they harbored several common misconceptions. Students tended to select a fraction algorithm, sometimes correctly and sometimes not, and use it – they rarely drew supporting pictures or diagrams to guide their decision on selecting an operation. Other errors included students misusing the algorithm by cross-multiplying instead of multiplying fractions straight across, failing to use inverse operations to solve the equations from basic algebraic concepts, and on the most difficult problems – namely in the computational fluency category – failing to even attempt the problems",,,
