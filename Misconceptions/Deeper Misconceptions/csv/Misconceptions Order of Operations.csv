,"The research population in the background research was 6th and 7th grade
 students in Israel and in Canada. In an attempt to discover whether wrong interpretations of the algebraic structure found in an algebraic context occur in a purely numerical one, we interviewed 53 sixth-graders individually. A study conducted by Linchevski and Livneh (1999) included interviews with 53 twelve year old students in four classes from two countries. Linchevski and Livneh asked students to solve the following five problems:

1. 5 + 6 × 10 =
2. 17 − 3 × 5 =
3. 8 × (5 + 7) =
4. 27 − 5 + 3 =
5. 24 ÷ 3 × 2 =",,,,,,

A sizable number of children added (5 + 3) before subtracting and multiplied (3 x 2) before dividing. One possible explanation might be that they have generalized incorrectly the rule for the order of operations and believe that addition takes precedence over subtraction and multiplication over division (e.g., in many textbooks we find that the order of operations is given as: Brackets first then 'Of', Multiplication, Division, Addition and Subtraction, often referred to as BOMDAS). Another explanation by one of the children re- flected another incorrect generalization, namely, ""Addition and subtraction are at the same level, so we choose what to do first as is more convenient"".",,"One possible explanation might be that they have generalized incorrectly the rule for the order of operations and believe that addition takes precedence over subtraction and multiplication over division.

Question 3 was answered correctly by all students, as they knew that the
 bracketed operation had to be performed first.

Many students who evaluated the expressions incoffectly
 were steadfast. As one of the students who was unshakeable stated, ""All
 the years I was taught that you first multiply. It's easier this way'"".","An overall look at the questions gave us four groups of students: (1) correct in all questions, 26%; (2) detachers in all questions, 26%; (3) sequential readers, 24%; and (4) others, 24%"

Most of the students who did not match (a) with (c) offered an explan- ation based on the surface structure of the expressions. As one of them said, ""They are not the same. Here (pointing at (a)), you have addition and subtraction and here (pointing at (c)), subtraction and addition"". Eight students did not see the equivalence because of detachment - they put mental brackets around 167 + 167 in (c), viewing it as 926 - (167 + 167). Another 21 students matched (c) [926 - 167 + 167] with (d) [926 - (167 + 167)], thereby demonstrating a detachment of the minus sign from the indicated term. As one of the students said, ""(c) and (d) are the same; they have the same numbers, the same operations and the same order"". He was then asked, ""But in (d) there are brackets. Don't they make any difference?"" He answered, ""You are supposed to do first what is in the brackets, and in (c) I judge what to do by observation"". A"
