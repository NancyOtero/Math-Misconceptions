,Ratios and Proportional Relationships,"Postetal.(1988) defined proportional reasoning as involving“...a sense of co variation, multiple comparisons, and the ability to mentally store and process several pieces of information” (p.79).","While a fraction represents a part/whole relationship, a ratio can represent a part/whole, part/part, or even a whole/part relationship. An aspect regarding ratios that middle school students find confusing is the number of different ways a ratio can be written (Kilpatrick, Swafford, & Findell, 2001). For example, the ratio of 12 girls in a class of 20 students could be written as 12/20, 12:20, or 12 to 20 if writing as a part/whole ratio. However, if asked to compare the number of girls to boys in the class, the ratio could be written as 12/8, 12:8 or 12 to 8.","Additionally, ratios can be written as a single number (e.g. 55 mpg, pi) and students may be asked to simplify ratios (e.g. 6:14 to 3:7) (Hoffer, 1988). Lamon (2012) also recognized students’ confusion associated with ratios written as fractions. She stated that students are often mistakenly taught to think of ratios only as a fractions (e.g. 3/4) representing a part-whole relationship. This oversimplified understanding causes students to be inflexible in moving back and forth between different meanings of ratios where 3/4 can mean a part/whole, part/part, or a whole/part relationship.","Another critical difference between fractions and ratios middle school students find challenging involves the correct approaches for combining two ratios (or fractions). Hoffer (1988) provided the following example of ratios: “2 hits out of 5 at-bats followed by 3 hits out of 7 at-bats yields 5 hits out of 12 at-bats” (p. 289). Here it is logical and correct to add the numerators and add the denominators. However, if this were an addition of fractions problem (2/5 + 3/7), adding the numerators and denominators would not be correct.","The overarching misconception identified during the in-depth interview was that students rigidly applied the procedure of linear proportionality to solve the problem. Students failed to realize that in an effort to maintain proportionality that they not only needed to multiply the dimension of height of the irregular figure by a factor, but also the width. De Bock, Van Dooren, Verschaffel, and Janssens (2002)",,,,
,,"proportional reasoning is not only mathematical, as described by y=mx+b, but also psychological. In order to reason proportionally, students must be able to reason multiplicatively. That is, they must have a solid understanding of rational numbers, equivalence, understand the parts of a ratio, analyze functional relationships, and in general decide whether an answer related to a proportional situation is reasonable","the numerous ways students might be asked to write, represent, or think about situations using ratios and proportions can be a perplexing.",,,The results of Singh’s study suggest that teaching students to rigidly use the unit rate method to solve proportions as a singular approach may result in students’ acquiring an instrumental understanding and may be counterproductive in students’ development of a relational understanding of proportional reasoning.

,,Wrinting a fraction to represent the shaded part of a figure,1. Wrote part (shaded)/part (not shaded) relationship instead of part/whole ,"Brown and Quinn found that students had a fragmented understanding of fraction concepts and fraction operations and they harbored several common misconceptions. Students tended to select a fraction algorithm, sometimes correctly and sometimes not, and use it – they rarely drew supporting pictures or diagrams to guide their decision on selecting an operation. Other errors included students misusing the algorithm by cross-multiplying instead of multiplying fractions straight across, failing to use inverse operations to solve the equations from basic algebraic concepts, and on the most difficult problems – namely in the computational fluency category – failing to even attempt the problems",Comparing decimals,1. Determined which decimal was greater simply by the number of digits,"common mistakes made by students in relation to decimal fractions: the belief that the longer the decimal fraction the larger the value (more digits, e.g. belief that 0.456 is larger than 0.47); the belief that the shorter the decimal fraction the larger the value (does not extend to as small of a place value (e.g. belief that 0.3 is larger than 0.432); confusion surrounding zeros which are to the right of the decimal point (not just a place holder, e.g. confused by 0.04); the belief that when comparing a decimal fraction such as 0.47 to 0 that zero is larger because the other digits are to the right of the decimal place; reciprical thinking that the smaller the digit the larger the value (confused with fractions); and difficulty with equaivalent representations – for example not understanding that 0.4 is the same as 0.40 or 0.400. Elementary and Middle School Mathematics: Teaching Developmentally ","Overall, Vlassis found that students had great difficulty in problems involving a subtraction sign followed directly by a negative sign (e.g. such as 5 − (−7)) when checking their answer by substituting the solution back into the equation. For example, students had trouble with the equation 4 − x = 5 because when checking their solution of x = −1 by substituting −1 back into the equation they were perturbed by 4 − (−1)","misconceptions involving integers: knowing to subtract when finding the sum of a positive and negative integer but not knowing what sign to label the sum; thinking that the sum of two negatives results in a positive (possibly confused with multiplication); and other incorrect uses of signs. Ashlock suggested that to support students in correcting these misconceptions and errors, number lines and set models should be used to teach for conceptual understanding.

While this misconception hinders students in algebra, it is really arithmetical in nature. Furthermore, in a report from Booth’s two-year project which analyzed students’ mathematical errors, he concluded that:",• the context of the problem determines the order of operations;,"Middle grades students ignore the use of grouping symbols, mainly because they consider them unnecessary.

Stacey and MacGregor (1997a) stated that “One of the most frequent algebraic acts is manipulation – changing an expression into an equivalent expression that has the same value, for example, replacing 3y+6 by 3(y+2)” (p. 256). Algebraic manipulations such as this one require students to have an intuitive sense of the properties of numbers. With regards to conceptual understanding of the proper- ties of numbers, Mason (1996) states that “Contemplating the properties of numbers is one way of standing back from the engagement in the particular, and becoming aware of the processes” (p. 70).",,

Incorrectly changing a whole number into a fraction (e.g. changing the whole number 6 into 6/6 instead of 6/1),,Exponents,,,"Schifter, Monk, Russell, and Bastable (2008) examined students’ understanding of the commutative, associative, and distributive properties. They found that with the commutative property, most students realized they would get the same answer if the order of the numbers were reversed. However, students tended to focus on the numbers themselves rather than the operations in the problem. This focus is troublesome because if students know that the answer is the same when the numbers are in either order, they overgeneralize and may fail to recognize that this is only true for addition and multiplication, and not for subtraction and division. They found that this is not the case with the associative property in which students do focus on the operations (Schifter et al., 2008).","Warren (2003) also examined students’ understanding of the properties of numbers. Warren administered a written test to 672 students ranging from age 11 to 14 to gauge their understanding of the commutative and associative properties. Students were asked to identify if the commutative and associative properties were true for addi- tion, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Almost all students correctly identified the commutative property. However, students also identified the commutative property as true for subtraction (16%) and division (18%). When asked about the associative property, unlike Schifter’s work, more students had incorrect responses. Overall, 80% of students identified the associative property as true for addition and 78% for multiplication while students incorrectly identified the associative property as true for subtraction (21%) and division (20%). Furthermore, when asked to provide examples demonstrating the truth or falsehood of these two properties, only 73% of students were able to provide examples for the commutative property and 58% for the associative property. Of those who provided examples, many students only used numbers in their explanation (Warren, 2003).",Warren (2003) suggested that students may harbor miscon- ceptions regarding properties of numbers because they do not have enough time to explore and make their own conjectures prior to middle school. He went on to state that this may be because elementary school mathematics is often taught in a non-calculator environment – where calculators can enhance the exploration of patterns and generalizations.

Divided fractions incorrectly by dividing the numerators and then dividing the denominators (overgeneralizing whole number operations),,"Pinchback (1991) confirmed a lack of understanding that even older algebra students have regarding exponents. Pinchback’s study found that students often did not interpret expressions such as (z − 4)2 correctly and instead translated it as (z − 4) (z + 4) (confusing it with the difference of two squares) or performed other incorrect procedures such as attempting to factor (z − 4)2 to (z + 2) (z − 2).

,,"Students’ misunderstanding of equality begins in elementary school when they often hold the misconception that the equal sign means “and the answer is?” (Ball, Thames, & Phelps, 2008","Stacey and MacGregor (1997a) found that this incorrect understanding of equality can be noted when students commonly work out a string of unequal problems mistakenly linking them with an equal sign such as 3 × (14 + 36) as 14 + 36 = 50 × 3 = 150. Likewise, in a multiple case study research project, Linchevski and Herscovics (1996) discovered that some participants used additional equal signs to show that two equations were equivalent by writings such as 17n+12n+36=210=29n+36=210 (p. 50).","Prior to middle school, students rarely understand that the equal sign is a relational symbol and serves as a balance with the total value on both sides the same. Falkner, Levi, and Carpenter (1999) found that while students struggle to solve a problem such as 4 + 5 = [] + 6 abstractly, it is rare that they have problems modeling the correct answer using manipulatives. Baroudi (2006) asked 27 eighth-grade students to write their definition of the equal sign. He found that one third of students gave a definition that viewed the equal sign as “the answer is” or “the answer is coming” although the relational meaning of the equal sign had previously been discussed.","Linchevski and Herscovics (1996) also found that even students in the seventh grade had an instrumental and rigid understanding of the equal sign. They conducted six case studies in an attempt to examine seventh-graders concept of equality. Students were shown the following equation on a balance: 5n + 3n + 11 = 5n + 11 + 39 and asked if they noticed any equal terms on both sides and if they thought those terms could be removed. Next, students were asked to solve the remaining equation, 3n = 39. Once the equation was solved, n = 13, students were asked if this solution was also true for the original equation, 5n + 3n + 11 = 5n + 11 + 39. Some students were not confident that the solution was true for the original equation and had to check by substituting n = 13 into the original equation. This finding suggests that middle grade students still struggle with the notion of equivalent equations","Steinberg, Sleeman, and Ktorza (1990) examined students’ understanding of equivalence using a more abstract approach. Eighth- and ninth-grade students were presented with 21 pairs of equations and were asked to determine if each pair was equivalent. For example, one pair of equations was x + 2 = 5 and x + 2 − 5 = 0. Analysis of student work found that student responses fell into three groups: (a) they computed solutions to determine equivalence; (b) they used transformations of equations; or (c) they used other incorrect reasons. The results indicated that students who transformed equations had more correct answers than students who calculated solutions. Some common incorrect reasoning students used to judge equivalence included; a lack of knowledge of basic algebra procedures for solving equations; a confusion regarding the difference between expressions such as 5x and 5 + x; only looking at one side of the equation instead of both; and attempting to rely on surface clues (Steinberg et al., 1990).","Booth and Watson (1990), Booth (1986), Kilpatrick et al. (2001), and Stacey and MacGregor (1997b) found that students (1) struggle with algebraic expressions because they do not conceptually understand what the variables mean, especially terms such as 7ab; and (2) struggle to understand an answer to a problem that is something other than a number (e.g. 3x + 1).","Kieran (1992) noted that, in addition to understanding what expressions mean, students struggle to accurately simplify expressions. For example, students attempt to simplify 30x – 5 to 25x or they do not correctly carry out the distributive property.","students are challenged by the difference between a variable and a label. For example, Weinberg et al. (2004) administered a written assessment of knowledge of algebraic expressions to sixth-, seventh-, and eighth- graders. They also interviewed 31 of the sixth-graders in semi-structured videotaped sessions. One question on the written assessment was the following: Cakes cost c dollars each and brownies cost b dollars each. Suppose I buy 4 cakes and 3 brownies. What does 4c + 3b stand for? (Weinberg et al., 2004, p. 4) Several students (22% in grade 6, 37% in grade 7, and 27% in grade 8) incorrectly stated that 4c + 3b meant 4 cakes and 3 brownies suggesting that the students incorrectly viewed the variables as labels. They thought c meant cakes instead of “times the cost of a cake” and b meant brownies instead of “times the cost of brownies.” Again these researchers suggested that teachers should practice caution when using first letter variables (as also found to be a problem in Swan, 2000).","To help students understand the different meanings of variables, Graham and Thomas (2000) had students use graphing calculators to practice using letters in three ways: as specified values, generalized numbers, and variables. Students used graphing calculators to store the letters a and b in the calculator in each of these three ways and then they analyzed a series of expressions. Using a pre/posttest design, Graham and Thomas’s (2000) found that graphing calculators helped students build a versatile view of the different uses of variables. Swan (2000) addressed the need for explicit instructional strategies for the difficult concept of variables and suggested the following methods for helping students understand algebraic expressions through multiple representations: “Comparing equivalent mathematical representations: Mathematical concepts have many representations, from conventionally accepted notations to informal mental representations. "
,,"Understanding equality should begin before abstract variables are introduced. Teaching students that the equal sign is a relational symbol that means “the same as” will prepare them for solving equations abstractly in middle school (Stacey & MacGregor, 1997b). Asquith, Stephens, Knuth, and Alibali (2007) stated that it is critical for students to have a relational understanding of the equal sign in order to realize the importance of preserving equivalence when performing inverse operations. “To make algebra the rich experience that it should be, teachers must realize that students have a tendency to lose sight of equivalence” (Van Dyke & Craine, 1997, p. 616). These interviews suggest that children consider the symbol = as a “do something signal.” There is strong tendency among all of the children to view the = symbol as being acceptable in a sentence only when one (or more) operation signs (+, −, etc.) precede it. Some children, in fact, tell us that the answer must come after the equal sign. We observe in the children’s behavior an extreme rigidity about written sentences, an insistence that statements be written in a particular form, and a tendency to perform actions (e.g. add), rather than to reflect, make judgments, and infer meanings. Moreover, we have some evidence to suggest that children do not change in their thinking about equality as they get older (Behr et al., 1980, p. 15).",,,"Knuth et al. (2011) conducted a study with students ranging from grades six through eight on their understanding of the equal sign. They found that at each grade level, the percentage of students who had developed a relational understanding of the equal sign, rather than an operational (instrumental) understanding although low, steadily increased. Of the sixth-grade students in their study, less than 30% demonstrated a relational understanding of the equal sign, whereas by eighth-grade, 46% of the students demonstrated a relational understanding.",,"Stacey and MacGregor (1997b) posed the following: “David is 10 cm taller than Con. Con is h cm tall. What can you write for David’s height?” (p. 111). They found that only 50% of seventh-grade and 75% of ninth- or tenth-grade students could write a correct expression representing David’s height (e.g. h + 10 or equivalent). As these students were in either their first year of algebra learning or beyond, these percentages were particularly alarming.",common misconception mentioned by Capraro and Joffrion (2006) was evident when students were asked to write a subtraction expression. Students often wrote “four less than a number” as 4 – n instead of n – 4.,,

,,"body of research related to students’ misconceptions regarding variables. These misconceptions include: viewing variables as labels (Asquith et al., 2007; Clement, 1982; Stacey & MacGregor, 1997b; Usiskin, 1988); thinking that two different variables (e.g. x, y) in the same equation cannot represent the same value (Stephens, 2005; Swan, 2000); believing the value of a variable has something to do with its position in the alphabet (Asquith et al., 2007; Herscovics & Kieran, 1980; MacGregor & Stacey, 1997); and failing to understand variables as varying quantities rather than a missing value (Asquith et al., 2007; Stacey & MacGregor, 2000; Stephens, 2005; Usiskin, 1988). Philipp (1992a) found that, “Much of the difficulty students encounter with variables may be related to their inability to recognize the correct role of the variable” (p. 560). Furthermore, Philipp noted that variables can take the following roles in algebra: labels, constants, unknowns, generalized numbers, varying quantities, parameters, and abstract symbols. From his work with interpreting students’ understanding of variables, Küchemann (1978) noted that variables can be used in multiple ways.",,,,,,,,

,,Evaluated,"The variable is directly evaluated Ex. x+6=12

MacGregor and Stacey found that students “. . .frequently base their interpretation of letters and algebraic expressions on intuition and guessing, on analogies with other symbol systems they know, or on a false foundation. . .” (p. 15). They also found that students perform better with variables as they get older; however, even students in grade 10 still struggled with the interpretation of variables. As one might assume, students across all grade levels performed better on the one-step expressions than with the two-step expressions or with expressions involving the use of the distributive property. In their findings, MacGregor and Stacey suggested that the root of the misconceptions and errors in the use of variables often lies in teachers’ instructional choices. For example, consistent use of the first letter of a word as the unknown confuses the difference between labels and variables. They found that students often do not understand that using variables can help them solve problems accurately and efficiently – which is essential for student success in learning algebra.
