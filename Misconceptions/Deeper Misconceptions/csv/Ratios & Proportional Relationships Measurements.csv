,"While a fraction represents a part/whole relationship, a ratio can represent a part/whole, part/part, or even a whole/part relationship. An aspect regarding ratios that middle school students find confusing is the number of different ways a ratio can be written (Kilpatrick, Swafford, & Findell, 2001). For example, the ratio of 12 girls in a class of 20 students could be written as 12/20, 12:20, or 12 to 20 if writing as a part/whole ratio. However, if asked to compare the number of girls to boys in the class, the ratio could be written as 12/8, 12:8 or 12 to 8.","The overarching misconception identified during the in-depth interview was that students rigidly applied the procedure of linear proportionality to solve the problem. Students failed to realize that in an effort to maintain proportionality that they not only needed to multiply the dimension of height of the irregular figure by a factor, but also the width. De Bock, Van Dooren, Verschaffel, and Janssens (2002)",The results of Singh’s study suggest that teaching students to rigidly use the unit rate method to solve proportions as a singular approach may result in students’ acquiring an instrumental understanding and may be counterproductive in students’ development of a relational understanding of proportional reasoning. Singh (2000),"Additionally, ratios can be written as a single number (e.g. 55 mpg, pi) and students may be asked to simplify ratios (e.g. 6:14 to 3:7) (Hoffer, 1988). Lamon (2012) also recognized students’ confusion associated with ratios written as fractions. She stated that students are often mistakenly taught to think of ratios only as a fractions (e.g. 3/4) representing a part-whole relationship. This oversimplified understanding causes students to be inflexible in moving back and forth between different meanings of ratios where 3/4 can mean a part/whole, part/part, or a whole/part relationship."

,"One way of describing this complex-
ity is to observe that, from the student’s point of view, a rational number is
not a single entity but has multiple personalities. The scheme that has guided
research on rational number over the past two decades 11 identifies the
following interpretations for any rational number, say 3
4 : (a) a part-whole re-
lation (3 out of 4 equal-sized shares); (b) a quotient (3 divided by 4); (c) a
measure ( 3
4 of the way from the beginning of the unit to the end); (d) a ratio
(3 red cars for every 4 green cars); and (e) an operation that enlarges or re-
duces the size of something ( 3
4 of 12). The task for students is to recognize
these distinctions and, at the same time, to construct relations among them
that generate a coherent concept of rational number. 12 Clearly, this process is
lengthy and multifaceted. (p 255)","Phase 1 Solving a word problem: Bart is publicity painter. In the last few days, he had to paint Christmas decorations on several store windows. Yesterday, he made a drawing of a 56 cm high Father Christmas on the door of a bakery. He needed 6 ml paint. Now he is asked to make an enlarged version of the same drawing on a supermarket window. This copy should be 168 cm high. How much paint will Bart approximately need to do this?
Two 15-16-year olds who gave the correct non-linear answer in this phase, all students calculated the amount of paint needed in a pro- portional way. Only one of these 38 students expressed some doubts about this linear approach (""You need more data, for instance the width"" [10- 19]), but this did not affect his solution. Strategies for finding the linear solution were, in order of importance, the internal ratio strategy (i.e. using the ratio between the heights of the Fathers Christmas: 168 ml/56 ml = 3, thus 3 x 6 ml = 18 ml), the 'rule of three' (i.e. via the amount of paint needed to paint 1 cm of the Father Christmas: 6 ml of paint for 56 cm, thus 0.107 ml for 1 cm, thus 0.107 x 168 ml = 18 ml for 168 cm) and the external ratio strategy (i.e. using the ratio between the amount of paint and the height in one Father Christmas: 6 ml/56 cm = 0.107 ml/cm, thus 0.107 ml/cm x 168 cm = 18 ml). 
Despite the fact that students were quite sure about the correctness of their answers, they had great difficulties explaining why their methods were correct. Initially, most students were unable to give any explanation at all. After insisting on a justification, students (a) referred to the fact that their solution is the most logical one, (b) explained that the Father Christmas is higher, so you need more paint and because it is three times as high, you need three times as much paint, (c) referred to the fact that the problem is about ratio or proportion. These superficial answers seem to indicate that students typically use the linear model in a spontaneous and thoughtless way and do not check whether this model is applicable in a given situation. Students do not seem to have clear arguments justifying its use, nor do they realise that there are competing models. Even the few students who realised that the enlargement acts in two dimensions did not necessarily give up the linear model. On the contrary, it was among these latter students that we observed the purest and most general expressions of the linear misconception (""It's 3 times bigger, not only the height but also the width. You can see it on the drawing. The whole thing is enlarged by factor 3, so you will need 3 times as much paint"" [10-08], ""I knew it was enlarged, but not how much, so I calculated 168: 56 and then I knew the multiplier"" [10-05], ""Because the picture becomes larger, you need more paint, so you have to multiply by three"" [7-19], ""It has the same shape, but it is enlarged, so you have to multiply the amount of paint by the same number"" [10-13]). Arguably, these students identified 'increase' with 'proportional increase', without making a clear mental representation of the problem situation (p. 9, 11-13)","Episode 2 Alice: R: Chin earns $63 in 6 weeks. If he earns the same amount of money each week, how much can he earn in 4 weeks? She sat quietly for a long six minutes. R: What are you thinking? A: Can I use the paper? R: Okay After about 4 minutes, A: $42 R: Can you explain how you got that? A: I divided 63 by 6 and I got 10.5 and then multiplied it with 4. R: If you don't find for 1 week, can you solve the problem? After a little while (3-4 minutes) A: I don't know. We are taught this way in school. R: What way? A: Find for one week and then multiply. (unit method) She seemed very persistent with the formal method although I thought that I had perturbed her by giving her a task where the ratio does not produce a whole number. I believe that because I allowed her to use paper, she continued with the method, which was successful for her. (p. 15, 16)",
,"Two simple examples illustrate
the point. First, recall (from chapter 4) the result from the National Assess-
ment of Educational Progress (NAEP)15 showing that more than half of U.S.
eighth graders chose 19 or 21 as the best estimate of 12
13 + 7
8 . When the correct answer is 187/104 or 1 83/104. These choices
do not make sense if students understand what the symbols mean and are
reasoning about the quantities represented by the symbols. Another survey
of students’ performance showed that the most common error for the addi-
tion problem 4 + .3 = ? is .7, which is given by 68% of sixth graders and 51% of
fifth and seventh graders.16 Again, the errors show that many students have
learned rules for manipulating symbols without understanding what those
symbols mean or why the rules work. Many students are unable to reason
appropriately about symbols for rational numbers and do not have the strate-
gic competence that would allow them to catch their mistakes. (p. 256)","Phase 2 Weak form of cognitive conflict: ""Last week, we gave this problem to pupils in another school.” Answers given: 18 ml - 43% of the pupils 54 ml - 43% of the pupils. Other answers - 14%
After being confronted with the manipulated frequency table with the cor- rect answer and the erroneous linear answer, only two of the thirty-eight students involved in Phase 2 began to think about a mathematical model that also takes into account the width of the enlarged Father Christmas. Both students ([7-10] and [10-14]) decided in favour of the correct, non- linear solution, although one of them argued that the width surely enlarges, but that it is impossible to know exactly how much ([10-14]). Being asked why they had given a wrong linear answer during Phase 1, both students admitted they had not thought about that (non-linear) solution and had not paid attention to the given drawings. For the majority of the thirty-six students who stuck to their original linear answer, the confrontation with the frequency table with the answers of fictitious peers really induced a cognitive conflict too: they started won- dering where that other frequently-chosen answer could come from. Re- markably, thirteen students discovered that this answer was obtained by a multiplication by 32 (or 9), but most of them immediately rejected this method as erroneous (""They multiplied by three two times! You see, they made a mistake. My answer is correct"" [7-01]). The twenty-three other students who did not find the origin of the alternative answer, searched for the rationale behind it in a more superficial way. For instance, they tried out 'randomly' some combinations with the basic arithmetical operations (+, -, x, :) on the given numbers, regardless of their contextual meaning (e.g. trying to arrive at the alternative solution by subtracting the heights of the Fathers Christmas). The reasons of the thirty-six students for per- sisting in their linear solution were typically very general and extrinsic (e.g., ""In general, I'm good in mathematics"" [10-03], ""You better always stay with your first solution"" [10-16]). Besides, they often indicated that the linear answer was self-evident (e.g., ""I would think my solution is much more logical"" [10-04], ""It's evident, you cannot do it otherwise"" [10-12]), while the non-linear answer was qualified as 'counterintuitive' or 'illogical' (e.g., ""In my opinion, this is a strange reasoning"" [10-15], ""That's too far-fetched"" [7-13], ""54 ml is quite a lot"" [10-04]). (p. 9, 11)","Episode 4 Alice: Although the earlier episodes were successful in eliciting some informa-tion about her thinking in proportional reasoning, I tried new tasks with the hope that she would give me insight into her thinking. R: John used exactly 15 cans to paint 18 chairs. How many chairs can he paint with 25 cans? I want you to try solving it, without using your school method. A: I will try Again she insisted on using the paper and after about seven minutes A: 810 chairs Here, she tried to carry out a procedure mentally R: Can you explain? She showed me the algorithmic procedures she did on her working paper. 15- 18 16- 17- 18 + 18 + 18= 54 cans 20 cans - 162 chairs (she got this by multiplying it by 3) 25 cans - 810 chairs (The algorithmic procedures on her working paper were: 162+162+162+162+162= 810) Alice was not able to construct a composite unit consisting of 15 to 18. Her reasoning seemed to be based on additive reasoning rather than multiplic-ative reasoning where each subsequent ratio is added on to the previous one. She was not able to unite a sequence of counting acts into composite units. Her 'adding' iteration was schematized as a ratio unit of 1 can to 18 chairs, where for each additional can, she added 18 chairs. R: Is it possible? A: I will do it in another way She reverted to the unit strategy, 18 divided by 15 = 1.2 and then multiplied it by 25 and got 30. A: 30 R: Which is correct, 810 chairs or 30 chairs? A: 30 is correct R: What is wrong with the 810? A: My calculation is wrong. She could not show me her mistakes and just stated that 30 was the an-swer. Alice did not identify the invariant elements of the situation and did not construct a ratio preserving relationship. In other words, she did not construct a relationship between the number of cans and numbers of chairs and furthermore she did not coordinate the units. (p. 17, 18)",
,"A second aspect is that students’ reasoning is facilitated as they distinguish between those features of a proportion situation that can change and those that must stay the same.46 In a proportion the quantities composing a ratio can change together in such a way that the relationship between them (the quotient) remains the same. Some students are inclined to take a more simplistic view, believing that if something changes, everything changes. In a proportion the numbers in the ratios can change but the multiplicative relationship must stay the same (e.g., $2 for 3 balloons expresses the same relationship as $4 for 6 balloons). The physical situation is not the same because the second ratio refers to twice as many dollars and balloons as the first. What is the same is the multiplicative relationship between the dollars and the balloons or, said another way, the cost of a single balloon (the unit rate). Written symbolically, without labels, the statement becomes 2 3 = 4 6 . But notice how the important contextual framework is lost with this abstract notation. (p. 264, 265)","Phase 3 Argumentation of fictitious peer. ""One student told me that if the Father Christmas becomes three times as high while keeping the same shape, not only its height is multiplied by 3, but also the width has to be multiplied by 3, so that you have to multiply the amount of paint by 9. 9 x 6 ml = 54 ml""
In the third phase, another fourteen students of the remaining thirty-six students (equally divided among both age groups) changed their incorrect answer into the correct one. Apparently, the argumentation of the fictitious peer who answered the problem correctly provided them the insight that to maintain the same shape, a figure has to be enlarged in all dimensions, having a quadratic effect on the area of the figure. The fourteen students who changed their answer were asked to explain why they originally gave the wrong linear solution. A first category of explanations referred to the fact that they did not approach the problem in a thoughtful way, but instead immediately and routinely (student [10-11] called it 
'instinctively') started to reason proportionally (""I started to solve the problem that way, and, so to speak, I closed myself for the other reasoning. No other reasoning could come up in my mind any more, also because this is the easiest way"" [10-18]). Second, some students argued that they did not notice the width, because they were fixating on the problem statement which only referred to the height (""I only paid attention to the text ... a little bit to the drawings, but above all to the text ... and in the text only the height is mentioned"" [7- 12], ""In the text, only the height is given. If both the height and the width were mentioned, I probably would have used another formula"" [10-18]). Third, there were students who realised that the enlargement also had an effect on the width, but deliberately did not take it into account because the width was not explicitly mentioned in the problem statement (""I thought that the width was relevant too, but because in the text no reference was made to the width, I decided to work with the height only"" [7-06]). The justifications of the twenty-two students who decided to stick to their original answer were diverse, but can be grouped into three different categories. A first group of students gave the non-linear reasoning a serious thought and were torn between the two alternative solutions, but they finally opted for the familiar linear model because they insufficiently understood the mathematical principles relevant to this problem. Some realised that the enlargement had an impact on the Fathers Christmas' width too, but were unsure about how much this width increased (""Height and width are not that much related to each other"" [10-04], ""The width changes too, but you cannot know how much"" [10-16]). Others struggled with the quadratic impact of a linear enlargement on a figure's area (or on the amount of paint, the indirect measure that is linearly related to this area) (""6 ml is for the whole Father Christmas, not only for the height. And 18 ml is for the whole large Father Christmas, for the height as well as for the width"" [7-08]).
For a second group of students the argumentation of the fictitious peer was an immediate cause to formulate their mistaken linear belief more clearly and more convincingly than ever before (""if you need 6 ml for this area and this area fits three times in that area, you need three times more paint"" [10-04]). This reasoning is similar to that of those students in the first group who struggled with the quadratic impact of a linear enlargement on a figure's area in the sense that they both improperly assumed a linear relationship between two quantities. However, this second group differs in the sense that its linear reasoning seemed not to be inspired by any specific mental representation of the problem situation, but rather by an application of linearity 'everywhere'. A third group of students justified their answer by referring to the im- plicit rules for solving school mathematics word problems (Verschaffel et al., 2000; Wyndhamn and Saljo, 1997). These students demonstrated a simplistic view on school word problem solving, assuming that all word problems can be solved by using simple mathematical calculations on the numbers given in the problem, and that real-world knowledge and context- based considerations should not be involved in the solution process. Some- times, this type of arguments also occurred in students belonging to the first two categories. Examples of justifications in this group are: ""I think that the pupils who gave this answer make it too complex for a word problem"" [7-13], ""In your calculation you can only involve numbers that are given"" [10-04], ""The word problem says nothing about the width at all, so it must be wrong"" [10-15]. Typically, these students rejected conflicting evidence arising from the given drawings (""In the drawing it is wider, but not in the word problem. The word problem is about the height only"" [7-09]). (p. 9, 14, 15)","Episode 5 R: In baking a cake, for every 8 eggs, one needs 18 cups of flour. If Mary has 4 cups of flour, how many eggs does she need? She used the unit method and computed 18 divided by 8 to match 1 cup with the number of eggs. She did it mentally and obtained 2.25 (which was actually 1 egg with 2.25 cups). When she multiplied 2,25 by 4 she found the result of 18 puzzling. ""That can't be!"" she said. Then she utilized the scalar method and com-puted a division of 18 by 4 which was 4.5. She wrote: 4.5 cups with 2 eggs 4 cups with 1.5 eggs (as both cups and eggs are lesser by 1/2) She utilizedt he additives trategy.T his seemed to indicatet hato ver reliance on the unit strategy tended to confuse Alice. When she tried to reason rather than follow a procedure, she thought additively. When the relationship between 15 and 8 was not an integer, she utilized the additive strategy and responded that 15 - 8 = 7 and so 6 + 7 = 13 cm. Within a minute she responded 11 cm. She found the difference between 36 -27 = 9 cm, p = 20 - 9 = 11 cm. Again, when the relationship between 36 and 27 was not an integer, she used the additive strategy. In other words, since 36 could not be multiplied by a number, she subtracted. Thus, it seems that since the reason for a search for a multiplicative relationship was not understood, she looked for any relationship in which the pair matched, and in this case it was additive reasoning. In short, when the relation was non-integral, she accepted a match based on additive reason-ing. (p. 18-20)",
,"Proportional reasoning is further enhanced as the first two aspects are connected with a third: Students’ reasoning is facilitated as they learn to build composite units, or units of units. The rate “$2 for 3 balloons” or “2-for-3” is a composite unit.47 The ability to use composite units is one of the most obvious differences between students who reason well with proportions and those who do not.48 Students who reason correctly about proportional situations often choose one ratio as a composite unit and use it as a comparative base. For example, they might use “2-for-3” to examine whether another ratio, such as 12-for-24, has the same relationship. By building up the 2-for-3 units (2-for-3, 4-for-6, 6-for-9, 8-for-12, 10-for-15, 12-for-18), the students realize 2-for-3 is not proportional to 12-for-24, because 12-for-24 cannot be generated with the 2-for-3 composite unit. There is a danger, of course, in using this essentially additive building-up process to generate equivalent ratios because students may not understand that the relationship is multiplicative. They need to see that 2-for-3 and 6-for-9, for example, express the same relationship or unit rate because 9 is the same multiple of 3 as 6 is of 2. But building from composite units does provide many students with a useful tool for working with proportional situations. (p. 265)","Phase 4 Solution process of fictitious peer: I""One student drew rectangles around the Fathers Christmas ...""
After the confrontation with the fictitious peer's solution process, namely actually drawing rectangles around the Fathers Christmas' irregular shapes, in Phase 4, another nine of the remaining twenty-two students (five 12- 13- and four 15-16-year olds) exchanged their initial linear answer for the correct non-linear one. It appeared that for these students, the circum- scribed rectangles seemed to function as a real 'Gestaltwechsel' (Wer- theimer, 1945), since they immediately and conclusively made a shift in their answers: ""Oh yes, now I see it. Indeed, it is nine times larger because the small rectangle also fits nine times in the large one. With the help of these rectangles I understand it. I am sure now, it should be 54 ml"" [7-04]. The uncertainty about how much the width increased, which was noted down several times at the previous phases, disappeared completely in these students. Before concluding the interview, these students were also asked why they originally gave a wrong linear answer and to it. Their reactions were very similar to those given on this question by the students who found the correct response in Phase 3. In the thirteen students who stayed with their original linear answer during Phase 4, no reflections were made about a mathematical model that takes into account the increased width of Father Christmas. Most students justified their answers by expressing their beliefs about how to solve math- ematical word problems (""Don't look too far for the solution of a school word problem"" [10-07], ""It's possible, but the width is not mentioned in the problem statement"" [7-09]) and about the role of and the relationship between textual and graphical information in a word problem (""It is nine times for the drawings, but three times for the word problem"" [10-08], ""Drawings are less accurate"" [10-04], ""You never should ground a solution in mathematics on a drawing. You have to ground it on formulas"" [10-15]) (cf. also Phase 3). Some students could not give any justification at all or just repeated their mistaken linear belief, sounding an attempt to convince the interviewer (""The little Father Christmas fits three times into the large one. It's the same for the rectangles. Three times more area, thus three times more paint"" [7-20]). Remarkably, the confrontation with the rectangles brought two of the thirteen students who stayed with their original linear answer ([7-03] and [7-13]) to express for the first time a strange misconception: the increase of area is different for the enlarged rectangles than for the irregular figures inscribed in these rectangles (in this case, the area scale factor was sup- posed to be nine for the rectangles, but three for the Fathers Christmas). Student [7-03] formulated it this way: ""What they do with the rectangle is correct: it enlarges in two directions. But within the rectangles is an irregular figure. And that's completely different. See here and here"" (points at the white parts in the rectangles (p. 9, 16)","RESEARCH METHODOLOGY

This study was conducted using a constructivist theory of learning. It was designed with the intention of focusing on a child's construction of proportional reasoning. That is, I, as the researcher, could closely monitor each student's thinking and the meaning he or she gave to the concepts of ratio and proportion. I set out to explore how two students construct proportional reasoning with the conjecture that each child would have a unique way of accomplishing this task.

Clinical interviews were the methodology adopted for this study. The assumptions underlying their use are: (1) A source of mathematical knowledge can be found in the ways that students act to resolve situations that they find to be genuinely problematic; and (2) Tasks can be designed which provide the researcher an adequate opportunity to make inferences based on the interviews about students' cognitive processes. Two main advantages of utilizing clinical interviews are, first, allowing for interventions where students were encouraged to elaborate on their statements and judgements; this provides an opportunity to make valid inferences about students' covert intellectual processes (Opper, 1975). Second, this approach to gathering data provides for a continual interaction between inference and observation (Cobb, 1986b). Hence, the researcher continually tests conjectures about the students' thinking and intervenes whenever the problem solving activity of the solver cannot be adequately explained by the model. The use of interviewing as a successful tool of research must be accompanied by appropriate learning tasks. According to Cobb (1986b), appropriate problem solving tasks are those which serve as genuine challenges for students, allowing them to become 'task-involved' during the interview. Specifically. (p. 4, 5)",
,"Proficiency with rational numbers, as with all mathematical topics, is signaled most clearly by the close intertwining of the five strands. Large-scale surveys of U.S. students’ knowledge of rational number indicate that many students are developing some proficiency within individual strands.8 Often, however, these strands are not connected. Furthermore, the knowledge students acquire within strands is also disconnected. A considerable body of research describes this separation of knowledge. (p.255)

On the 1996 NAEP, only 12% of eighth-grade students could solve a problem involving the comparison of two rates, 8 miles every 10 minutes and 20 miles every 25 minutes.42 Research tracing the development of proportional reasoning shows that children have some informal knowledge of proportions. Studies with second graders have suggested that their intuitive understanding is insufficient for solving certain proportion problems. (p.264)","Phase 5 Explicit link with area measurement: * ""Can you calculate the area of the two rectangles?"" * ""How much larger is the area of the large recta-ngle compared to the small one?' * ""How much larger is the area of the large Father Christmas compared to the small one?"" * ""How much more paint do you need to paint the large Father Christmas?”
In this final phase, yet five other students of the remaining thirteen students (three 12-13- and two 15-16-year olds) left the wrong linear answer and exchanged it for the correct non-linear answer. All five students correctly calculated the area of both rectangles and, to their astonishment, found that the area of the larger rectangle was indeed nine times the area of the smaller one. Three of them felt no difficulties to generalise this last finding to the 'irregular' Fathers Christmas within these rectangles and to the amounts of paint needed to paint them. However, two students ([7-15] and [10-03]) only succeeded in drawing this conclusion after the inter- viewer provided them with still an extra scaffold (e.g. after the interviewer had asked them to compare the amounts of paint needed to paint the two rectangles). Moreover, an ultimate choice for the correct answer did not necessarily remove all doubts (e.g., ""OK, it is nine times more paint. But I still don't see why my original calculation was not correct"" [10-03]). Even after four types of increasing cognitive conflicts, eight students maintained their linear answer until the very end of the interview. While arguing their choice, these students even stronger stuck up for their beliefs about how to solve word problems and about the role of drawings in word problem solving (""For the drawings, it is nine times, but this is not that relevant. In a word problem you are expected to work with the data that are provided in the text. Using drawings and measuring is less accurate"" [10-04]) (see also Phases 3 and 4). Some of these persisting students also seemed to be worried about the role of 'amount of paint' as an indirect measure for 'area' in this context (""It's about 'consumption of paint' and you don't have to solve it via area"" [7-02], ""For the area, it is nine times, but for the amount of paint, I'm not so sure. Millilitre is not referring to area, but rather to volume"" [10-08]). (p. 9, 16, 17)",,
,,"METHOD

Twenty seventh graders (12-13-year olds) and twenty tenth graders (15- 16-year olds) participated in the interview study. The participants came from a boarding-school located in a medium-sized Flemish town and were equally divided over most of the study streams of general secondary edu- cation. The number of boys and girls in the school as well as in our sample was more or less the same. All interviews were audio-taped and the inter- viewees had some pieces of paper, writing materials, a ruler and a scientific calculator at their disposal. The interviews consisted of five phases: after a short introduction, the interviewee was confronted with a non-proportional problem (Phase 1), followed by four subsequent forms of help to solve that problem (Phases 2, 3, 4, and 5). The interview stopped in the phase wherein the students discovered the non-linear nature of the problem and gave the correct response. If no form of help proved to be successful, the interview stopped at the end of Phase 5. The forms of help provided in Phases 2 to 5 aimed at eliciting a cognitive conflict in students who fell into the 'linearity trap'. Eliciting a cognitive conflict is a well-known method to create cognitive disequilibrium in a learner and to lead him or her to the discovery and development of new ideas (Forman and Cazden, 1985; Limon, 2001). In the present study, the cognitive conflict was evoked by presenting parts of the problem-solving protocol of a fictitious peer who proposes a (correct) non-linear solution to the problem. (p. 6, 5)",,
