Sample questions description,1) Data representation,
,"Histograms, line graphs, scatterplots, box plots, bar graphs, circle graphs, stem and leaf plots, frequency distributions, and tables. ",
,"a) Read or interpret data, including interpolating or extrapolating from data.",
"4, D, 17

Complete a circle graph to represent data in a table","b) For a given set of data, complete a graph and then solve a problem using the data in the graph (histograms, line graphs, scatterplots, circle graphs, and bar graphs).",
,c) Solve problems by estimating and computing with data from a single set or across sets of data,
"24, D, 22

Select the graph that best represents the given data","d) Given a graph or a set of data, determine whether information is represented effectively and appropriately (histograms, line graphs, scatterplots, circle graphs, and bar graphs). ",
"24, D, 17

Compare the means of two sets of data (calculator available)",e) Compare and contrast the effectiveness of different representations of the same data. ,
,,
,2) Characteristics of data sets,
,"a) Calculate, use, or interpret mean, median, mode, or range. ",
,"b) Describe how mean, median, mode, range, or interquartile ranges relate to distribution shape. ",
,"c) Identify outliers and determine their effect on mean, median, mode, or range. ",
,"d) Using appropriate statistical measures, compare two or more data sets describing the same characteristic for two different populations or subsets of the same population. ",
,e) Visually choose the line that best fits given a scatterplot and informally explain the meaning of the line. Use the line to make predictions. ,
,,
,3) Experiments and samples,
,"a) Given a sample, identify possible sources of bias in sampling. ",
,b) Distinguish between a random and nonrandom sample.,"7.SP.A.1
Understand that statistics can be used to gain information about a population by examining a sample of the population; generalizations about a population from a sample are valid only if the sample is representative of that population. Understand that random sampling tends to produce representative samples and support valid inferences."
,d) Evaluate the design of an experiment. ,
,,
,4) Probability,
"26, D, 17

Use theoretical probability to predict an outcome (calculator available)",a) Analyze a situation that involves probability of an independent event. ,
,b) Determine the theoretical probability of simple and compound events in familiar contexts.,
,c) Estimate the probability of simple and compound events through experimentation or simulation. ,
,d) Use theoretical probability to evaluate or predict experimental outcomes. ,
,e) Determine the sample space for a given situation. ,
,f ) Use a sample space to determine the probability of possible outcomes for an event. ,
,"g) Represent the probability of a given outcome using fractions, decimals, and percents. ",
,h) Determine the probability of independent and dependent events. (Dependent events should be limited to a small sample size.) ,
,j) Interpret probabilities within a given context.,
