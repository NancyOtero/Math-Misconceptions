,Exhibit 3. Number properties and operations,,,
,1) Number sense:,,,
,"a) Use place value to model and
describe integers and decimals.",,,
,b) Model or describe rational numbers or numerical relationships using number lines and diagrams. ,"6.NS.C.6
Understand a rational number as a point on the number line. Extend number line diagrams and coordinate axes familiar from previous grades to represent points on the line and in the plane with negative number coordinates.",,
,d) Write or rename rational numbers.,,,
,"e) Recognize, translate or apply multiple representations of rational numbers (fractions, decimals, and percents) in meaningful contexts.",,,
,f ) Express or interpret numbers using scientific notation from real-life contexts. ,"8.EE.A.4
Perform operations with numbers expressed in scientific notation, including problems where both decimal and scientific notation are used. Use scientific notation and choose units of appropriate size for measurements of very large or very small quantities (e.g., use millimeters per year for seafloor spreading). Interpret scientific notation that has been generated by technology.",,
,g) Find or model absolute value or apply to problem situations.,,,
,"h) Order or compare rational numbers (fractions, decimals, percents, or integers) using various models and representations (e.g., number line).","6.NS.C.7
Understand ordering and absolute value of rational numbers.",,
,"i) Order or compare rational numbers including very large and small integers, and decimals and fractions close to zero. ","8.EE.A.3
Use numbers expressed in the form of a single digit times an integer power of 10 to estimate very large or very small quantities, and to express how many times as much one is than the other.",,
,,,,
,2) Estimation,,,
,"a) Establish or apply benchmarks for rational numbers and common irrational numbers (e.g., π) in contexts.","8.NS.A.1
Know that numbers that are not rational are called irrational. Understand informally that every number has a decimal expansion; for rational numbers show that the decimal expansion repeats eventually, and convert a decimal expansion which repeats eventually into a rational number.","8.NS.A.2
Use rational approximations of irrational numbers to compare the size of irrational numbers, locate them approximately on a number line diagram, and estimate the value of expressions (e.g., pi²).",
,"b) Make estimates appropriate to a given situation by:

• Identifying when estimation is appropriate,
• Determining the level of
accuracy needed,
• Selecting the appropriate
method of estimation, or
• Analyzing the effect of an
estimation method on the
accuracy of results. ",,,
,"c) Verify solutions or determine the reasonableness of results in a variety of situations, including calculator and computer results.",,,
,"d) Estimate square or cube roots of numbers less than 1,000 between two whole numbers. ",,,
,,,,

,a) Perform computations with rational numbers. ,"7.NS.A.1
Apply and extend previous understandings of addition and subtraction to add and subtract rational numbers; represent addition and subtraction on a horizontal or vertical number line diagram.",,
,"d) Describe the effect of multiplying and dividing by numbers including the effect of multiplying or dividing a rational number by:

• Zero, or
• A number less than zero, or
• A number between zero
and one,
• One, or
• A number greater than one.","6.NS.B.2

Interpret and compute quotients of fractions, and solve word problems involving division of fractions by fractions, e.g., by using visual fraction models and equations to represent the problem.",,
,f ) Solve application problems involving rational numbers and operations using exact answers or estimates as appropriate. ,"6.NS.C.8
Solve real-world and mathematical problems by graphing points in all four quadrants of the coordinate plane. Include use of coordinates and absolute value to find distances between points with the same first coordinate or the same second coordinate.","7.NS.A.3
Solve real-world and mathematical problems involving the four operations with rational numbers.",
,,,,
,4) Ratios and proportional reasoning,,,
,a) Use ratios to describe problem situations.,"6.RP.A.3
Use ratio and rate reasoning to solve real-world and mathematical problems, e.g., by reasoning about tables of equivalent ratios, tape diagrams, double number line diagrams, or equations.","6.RP.A.1
Understand the concept of a ratio and use ratio language to describe a ratio relationship between two quantities.",
,b) Use fractions to represent and express ratios and proportions.,"7.RP.A.1
Compute unit rates associated with ratios of fractions, including ratios of lengths, areas and other quantities measured in like or different units.","6.RP.A.2
Understand the concept of a unit rate a/b associated with a ratio a:b with b is not equal to 0, and use rate language in the context of a ratio relationship.",
,c) Use proportional reasoning to model and solve problems (including rates and scaling). ,"7.RP.A.2
Recognize and represent proportional relationships between quantities.",,
,"d) Solve problems involving percentages (including percent increase and decrease, interest rates, tax, discount, tips, or part/ whole relationships). ","7.RP.A.3
