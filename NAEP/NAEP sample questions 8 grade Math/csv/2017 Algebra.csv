x,Make and explain a conclusion about two linear equations in context,,"Sample Correct Response:

(a) Correct selection:

The monthly fee of Gym A is less than the monthly fee of Gym B.

(b) Explanation:

Gym A has a higher initial fee than Gym B. The two gyms have the same total cost after 12 months, so in order for the total cost of Gym B to reach to the total cost of Gym A, the monthly fee for Gym A must be less than the monthly fee for Gym B.","Correct:

Correct selection with an acceptable explanation

Partial:

Incorrect or no selection with an acceptable explanation that supports the correct selection


NOTE:

An acceptable explanation must include:

A comparison between the initial fees of the two gyms, and
A reference to equivalent total costs after 12 months.","Correct - Student Response 1:

""The monthly fee of Gym A is less than the monthly fee of Gym B.""

""My reason to my answer is because in the information it gives it states that GYM A and GYM B yearly membership is the same. It also states that Gym A has a higher annual fee wich means that Gym B needs the hace a higher monthly fee to equal the same price as Gym A.""


Correct - Student Response 2:

""The monthly fee of Gym A is less than the monthly fee of Gym B.""

""Because Gym B would have to have a greater monthly one because Gym A has a bigger anual fee but they cost the same year around"".

These correct responses each include a correct selection and an acceptable explanation. The explanations in both responses are acceptable because they compare the initial fees of the two gyms and give reference to the fact that the total cost is the same after 12 months.


Partial - Student Response 1:

""The monthly fee of Gym A is equal to the monthly fee of Gym B.""

""The reason why both gyms have the same cost every year but have two different annual costs is because gym B cost more monthly but gym A costs more annualy which causes both to add up to the same sum of money"".


Partial - Student Response 2:

""The monthly fee of Gym A is equal to the monthly fee of Gym B.""

""The script say the yearly cost is the same, one annual fee is more A and one monthly fee is more B.""

These partially correct responses each include an incorrect selection and an acceptable explanation. The explanations in both responses are acceptable because they compare the initial fees of the two gyms and give reference to the fact that the total cost is the same after 12 months.

Correct selection with an unacceptable explanation or no explanation

Incorrect 2:

Other incorrect responses


Incorrect 1 - Student Response 1:

""The monthly fee of Gym A is less than the monthly fee of Gym B.""

""If both gym´s have the same yearly fee then the monthly fee for gym B has to be greater.""


Incorrect 1 - Student Response 2:

""The monthly fee of Gym A is less than the monthly fee of Gym B.""

""Because if Gym A has a higher anual fee than im thinking that Gym B will have a higher cost monthly.""

These incorrect responses each include a correct selection and an unacceptable explanation. The explanation in the top response is incorrect because it does not include a comparison between the initial fees of the two gyms, while the bottom does not include a reference to equivalent total costs after 12 months.


Incorrect 2 - Student Response 1:

""The monthly fee of Gym A is equal to the monthly fee of Gym B.""

""They both have the same yearly fee so they both are going to be equal to one another no matter how much they pay each month because at the end of the year they would still pay the same amount.""


Incorrect 2 - Student Response 2:

""The monthly fee of Gym A is more than the monthly fee of Gym B.""

""More than""

These incorrect responses include an incorrect selection and an unacceptable explanation.
