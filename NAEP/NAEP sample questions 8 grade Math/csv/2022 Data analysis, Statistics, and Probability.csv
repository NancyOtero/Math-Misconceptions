,,,"(b) Answer: $9.40 (accept answers between $8 and $12 exclusive)

Solution (not required in response):

The approximate price of raisins in 1-pound packages is $4.75 per pound. You need 4 pounds at this price so the total price will be 4 x $4.75 = $19.

The approximate price of raisins in 2-pound packages is $2.40 per pound. You need 4 pounds at that price so the total price will be 4 x $2.40 = $9.60.

The 1-pound packages will be $19 - $9.60 = $9.40 more expensive.",,,,,,,,,,
