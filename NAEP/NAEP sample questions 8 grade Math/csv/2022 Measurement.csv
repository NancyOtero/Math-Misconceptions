,Calculate and compare the areas of two shapes,,,"Correct:

Both parts correct

Partial:

Part (a) correct only

Partial 2:

Part (b) correct only

Partial 3:

Part (b) correct based on an incorrect part (a)","Correct - Student Response 1:

(a) 2 square units

(b) 1 square unit


Correct - Student Response 2:

(a) 2 square units

(b) 2 - 1 = 1 Square Unit

These correct responses show a correct area of 2 square units for square CDEF for part (a) and a correct difference between the areas of squares CDEF and ABCG of 1 square unit for part (b).


Partial 1 - Student Response 1:

(a) 2 square unit

(b) CDGF is 1 squarevunit and ABCG is 2


Partial 1 - Student Response 2:

(a) 2

(b) 2 > 1

These partially correct responses show a correct area of 2 square units for square CDEF for part (a) and a difference between the areas of squares CDEF and ABCG other than 1 square unit for part (b). The first response provides an answer in part (b) that incorrectly indicates the area of ABCG is 2 square units and the area of square CDEF (typed as CDGF) is 1 square unit and does not provide a difference that is a result of subtracting the areas of the squares. The second response provides an answer in part (b) that indicates 2, the area of square CDEF, is greater than 1, the area of square ABCG, but does not provide a difference that is a result of subtracting the areas of the squares.


Partial 2 - Student Response 1:

(a) 3 square units

(b) 1


Partial 2 - Student Response 2:

(a) 4

(b) its1 square unit

These partially correct responses show an area for square CDEF other than 2 square units for part (a) and a correct difference between the areas of squares CDEF and ABCG of 1 square unit for part (b).


Partial 3 - Student Response 1:

(a) 1 1/2 square units

(b) cdef is 1/2 square units bigger then abcg


Partial 3 - Student Response 2:

(a) 8

(b) 8 - 1

These partially correct responses show a difference between the areas of squares CDEF and ABCG for part (b) that is consistent with the incorrect area for square CDEF that was given in part (a). For an answer in part (b) to be consistent with an incorrect answer in part (a), the answer in part (b) must be equal to the answer in part (a) minus 1 or to 1 minus the answer in part (a). In each response, the difference in part (b) is equal to 1 square unit less than the area in part (a).",,8,2022,8M1,SCR (Short Constructed Response),Hard,"Correct: 22%
