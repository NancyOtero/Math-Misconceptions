Math Misconceptions: Mapping Major Math Misunderstandings
By Nancy Otero

Educators and researchers have spent decades studying learners’ ideas, errors, and misconceptions, but the use of that knowledge has not yet permeated the classroom. Discovering learners’ conceptions and misconceptions can be a daunting activity for teachers, and today’s multiple-choice technology is not ready for analyzing networks of conceptual misconceptions. 

How can we use all the research and knowledge on learners’ ideas, errors, and misconceptions to develop students’ mathematical thinking and increase math learning? How can the discovery of learners’ attempts to make sense of math lead us to better ways of thinking about and teaching math?

I have been passionate about the idea of misconceptions for ten years now. I used it to explain to learners the importance of reflecting in their process of learning and for them to see those misconceptions not as simple errors but as a natural part of building deeper understandings that need to be constantly thought of. I supported educators in using the [MOZART project](https://pweb.cfa.harvard.edu/research/misconception-oriented-standards-based-assessment-resources-teachers-mosart). -- a set of science tests to diagnose misconceptions -- to learn how well students understand various concepts in science. Educators reported finding the MOZART project very useful, but I haven’t found a similar instrument for math. 

This article describes a work in progress on math misconceptions. This first phase focuses on gathering the most common algebra-related misconceptions and errors in the existing literature. The reason is that passing [6th-grade math](https://new.every1graduates.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/preventing_student_disengagement.pdf) is one of the top predictors of high school graduation.

The Mapping Algebra Misconceptions (MAM) project is sponsored by The Learning Agency and conducted by me, Nancy Otero. A special thanks to John Whitmer, who has supported this project from its beginning and provided valuable insights.

Background 

Research suggests that learners construct more advanced knowledge from previous understanding; learners are not a black slate when they approach instruction. Learners’ previous conceptions can be a resource for cognitive growth (Smith et al. [1993](https://faculty.weber.edu/eamsel/Classes/Practicum/TA%20Practicum/papers/Smith,%20DiSessa,%20&%20Roschelle%20(1993-4).pdf)). These conceptions (or misconceptions) are an opportunity to play, own, experience, and think about ideas as learners do in many other activities. This learner’s exercise in making sense of math also gives a window into how they construct their understanding. Making sense of and addressing learners’ misconceptions can improve math performance (Ashlock [2010](https://www.amazon.com/Robert-B-Ashlock-Patterns-Computation/dp/B008UBBX9S)) and support their ownership of doing math (Li [2019](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40594-019-0197-9)). 

For these reasons I included a relation of the MaE to the Common Core, hoping it can be a tool for educators in their lesson planning. I included one example here
