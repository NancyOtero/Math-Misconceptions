# Math-Misconceptions
Math Misconceptions: Mapping Major Math Misunderstandings
By Nancy Otero

Educators and researchers have spent decades studying learners’ ideas, errors, and misconceptions, but the use of that knowledge has not yet permeated the classroom. Discovering learners’ conceptions and misconceptions can be a daunting activity for teachers, and today’s multiple-choice technology is not ready for analyzing networks of conceptual misconceptions. 

How can we use all the research and knowledge on learners’ ideas, errors, and misconceptions to develop students’ mathematical thinking and increase math learning? How can the discovery of learners’ attempts to make sense of math lead us to better ways of thinking about and teaching math?

I have been passionate about the idea of misconceptions for ten years now. I used it to explain to learners the importance of reflecting in their process of learning and for them to see those misconceptions not as simple errors but as a natural part of building deeper understandings that need to be constantly thought of. I supported educators in using the [MOZART project](https://pweb.cfa.harvard.edu/research/misconception-oriented-standards-based-assessment-resources-teachers-mosart). -- a set of science tests to diagnose misconceptions -- to learn how well students understand various concepts in science. Educators reported finding the MOZART project very useful, but I haven’t found a similar instrument for math. 

This article describes a work in progress on math misconceptions. This first phase focuses on gathering the most common algebra-related misconceptions and errors in the existing literature. The reason is that passing [6th-grade math](https://new.every1graduates.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/preventing_student_disengagement.pdf) is one of the top predictors of high school graduation.

The Mapping Algebra Misconceptions (MAM) project is sponsored by The Learning Agency and conducted by me, Nancy Otero. A special thanks to John Whitmer, who has supported this project from its beginning and provided valuable insights.

**Background**

Research suggests that learners construct more advanced knowledge from previous understanding; learners are not a black slate when they approach instruction. Learners’ previous conceptions can be a resource for cognitive growth (Smith et al. [1993](https://faculty.weber.edu/eamsel/Classes/Practicum/TA%20Practicum/papers/Smith,%20DiSessa,%20&%20Roschelle%20(1993-4).pdf)). These conceptions (or misconceptions) are an opportunity to play, own, experience, and think about ideas as learners do in many other activities. This learner’s exercise in making sense of math also gives a window into how they construct their understanding. Making sense of and addressing learners’ misconceptions can improve math performance (Ashlock [2010](https://www.amazon.com/Robert-B-Ashlock-Patterns-Computation/dp/B008UBBX9S)) and support their ownership of doing math (Li [2019](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40594-019-0197-9)). 

For these reasons I included a relation of the MaE to the Common Core, hoping it can be a tool for educators in their lesson planning. I included one example here

**Errors vs Misconceptions**

It's worth understanding that errors and misconceptions are related, but different in important ways that matter. 

Learners’ computational errors mean that they haven’t mastered how to use a rule. Overcoming computational errors is vital because the learner can carry on errors in fundamental procedures from which more complex math is built for years. For instance Bush [2011](https://ir.library.louisville.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1186&context=etd) found that 16.5% of her sample answers to algebra questions from middle school learners made basic computational errors with whole numbers. 

As an example of a computational error, some learners consistently make the sum of two negatives a positive, -6 - 3 = 9 or -5 - 4= 9 (Ashlock [2010](https://www.amazon.com/Robert-B-Ashlock-Patterns-Computation/dp/B008UBBX9S)). The cause of computational errors can be multiple: because of lacking understanding of why that rule is that way, having a misconception on what the rule is that way, underdeveloped understanding of a particular underlying concept, an error while learning the rule, or a mistake applying the rule, etc. Researchers have found several common computational errors, and identifying them can be used to determine the cause. 

Misconceptions are a mistake in conceptual understanding and they have relations with all the applications of those concepts. For example, a single misconception on the connections among proportional relationships (part/whole, part/part, whole/part) can cause problems in identifying those patterns in drawings and can be the cause of failing to realize all parts must be of equal size, therefore associating the denominator of the fraction with the total number of parts regardless their size. 

Sometimes misconceptions about conceptual understandings are related to the form that teachers represent math. For example, [Baroudi (2006)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aogV6bu5cncMROSMrq6WprHVLEnhVn31/view?usp=share_link) reported that misconceptions of equivalence can be attributed to the fact learners experience the equal sign always at the end of an equation and only one number comes after it. In a study, learners were asked to solve 8 + 4 = [ ] + 5, and all learners answered that either 12 or 17 should go in the box. Another cause of conceptual misconception is a teaching practice that focuses on procedures mostly instead of emphasizing concepts (Van de Walle et al. [2010](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268631106_Elementary_and_middle_school_mathematics_Teaching_developmentally)). 

One challenge to the distinctions between misconception and error is that there are other learning obstacles researchers and educators mention. For example, the natural learning bias (Van Hoof et al., [2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959475214000346)) is an inappropriate application of natural number’s features to rational numbers caused by the learners’ natural-numbers-based intuitive idea of what a number is (Vamvakoussi & Vosniadou, [2004](https://d1wqtxts1xzle7.cloudfront.net/67091379/Vamvakoussi_2004-libre.pdf?1620211779=&response-content-disposition=inline%3B+filename%3DUnderstanding_the_structure_of_the_set_o.pdf&Expires=1677012706&Signature=ZLHLsYfCXnXqgmvihuCM7E20XVHRIgrLmLnKBm-L50AIfrECwfBK3BpzcvcvsNx1obbjsBA7fZ4SSDKYT-EytCT0Y8TCTCwQle4oBgkBQpB2wSeWBY5dW0JGLpspSYayyEO6YyNz9ptLQXzwD0IVcREYasZ8Dii1WctLkPwTGvuX0Mzb1fyn4nIQ7kkZiX73lAPTDvHaPNgEnbMtJ2xEJY9SRmyWD047e7to78w1nq7eMa9duNjZjqLvDUZCDQaNIdzRzwyckKpTPIgU7GOR-fRRZi~oF1n8a38u-RAMTee-nfKvH4EAw4N6vz4KXqChaDwR5NsXpTcUSo8cXjz4Rw__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLOHF5GGSLRBV4ZA)). This bias has many consequences in learners’ practice. For now, I included expressions of this bias related to algebra, like ordering decimals incorrectly by basing the value of a decimal on its number of digits as if it was a natural number. For example: Thinking 0.25 is larger than 0.7, this bias will have implications for learners thinking about expressions such as “x/4 < x”. Including these learning obstacles might be a future extension of this project, given their importance and connection with misconceptions and errors. 

An important difference between errors and misconceptions is that diagnosing conceptual misconceptions can be harder than computational errors in a typical classroom or by using multiple choice technology. Researchers have used interviews and paper-pencil work that show the learner’s thinking in order to discover them. This level of focus on each learner can be hard to achieve but today’s technology might be able to offer some help.
